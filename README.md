# Google-map-API-INTEGRATION
In this respository I am going to show you how to integrate google map API and make it work on your website after a button click event.
Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing one.
Enable the "Maps JavaScript API" for your project.
Generate an API key from the Google Cloud Console.
Restrict the API key to only allow usage from specific domains for security reasons.
npm install google-maps-react
